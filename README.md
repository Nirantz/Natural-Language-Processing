As a committee member responsible for summarizing daily news for morning meetings, you need to
summarize the day's news for the committee and highlight the ten most important stories that you think
the committee should focus on. With limited time to read every news article in detail, you want to use
an automatic text summarization system to quickly generate a summary of the news headlines. This is
where the automatic text summarization system developed in this project comes in handy. You can use
the system to quickly generate a summary of the news headlines and identify the ten most important
stories based on the summary. This will save you time and ensure that you are well-informed before the
committee meeting.
